Requirements:
=============

1. PIL (aka python-imaging in most unix systems).

2. python development files (it could be python-dev in unix systems).

3. gcc and usual tools for compiling and installing.


Installing a BioPlone site:
===========================

1. Run bootstrap.py with the python interpreter you want to use. This
will install Buildout.

  $ python2.4 bootstrap.py

  or if you've used MacPorts for MacOSX to install your python 2.4:

  $ /opt/local/bin/python2.4 bootstrap.py

  or if you've used Fink for MacOSX to install your python 2.4:

  $ /sw/bin/python2.4 bootstrap.py

2. Edit the newly created buildout.cfg to select the profile you want to
use; production, staging or development. For example:

  [buildout]
  extends = profiles/development.cfg
  
note: If you intend to run the development profile you don't need to
change anything here.

3. Run buildout

  $ bin/buildout -v

note: it may take some time ...

4. Start up the instance

  $ bin/instance fg
  
5. Log into the ZMI at http://localhost:8080/manage as (admin/admin).
Create a Plone site and then go to the quickinstaller and install the
following products:

   plone4bio
   plone4bio.predictor
   plone4bio.prodiv
  
Now you should be able to add new Sequence types to your Plone site and
to run the Prodiv (http://www.pdc.kth.se/~hakanv/prodiv-tmhmm/) code
against it.

6. To extend the BioPlone site with new predictors, refer to the
skeleton code in plone4bio.predictor: you should be able to create a set
of tools to run against your sequences.
